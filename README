delta is a library (and an associated utility) which allow
us to perform binary diff and patching in an efficient way. It
is similar in function to xdelta and vcdiff (RFC 3284), but more
(space-)efficient.

The delta(1) utility takes 3 arguments - oldfile, newfile and
patchfile - and creates the patchfile from the binary difference of
the old and new files. There's an optional -d or -p to diff and
to patch, respectively. The default is to patch.

	% delta -d 2 1 2.diff
	% delta -p 2 1.new 2.diff
	% diff 1 1.new
	%

The patchfile uses bzip2, and is more efficient than both xdelta (v1)
by Josh MacDonald, and bsdiff from Colin Percival, dated 2005.  I've
not tried xdelta3 yet.  It also uses zigzag encoding for the numbers
stored internally, in order to be space-efficient.
